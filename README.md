# flex admin console

This is an alternate admin console built on the Flex integration SDK. The motivation is to allow the use of FFS in production. In effect, this is the FFS console app. Hopefully you'll prefer it to the Sharetribe console, and can use it instead of, or as well as their console app.

## Quick start (no such thing!)

You will need:

If you are using a sharetribe provided backend (as oppose to FFS), you will need both the FLEX_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID and 14cd97d21409e22c720e58fbf872a2113fb7d1e2 keys. In FFS these are ignored (make them up).

## Getting started with customization

You need to understand how Flex is architected. Read the FTW customization guides and the Flex SDK documentatio. 

Some familarity with javascript/React/Redux apps will be helpful in customizing this  template.

## Documentation

See the Flex Docs site: https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/ to understand what we're attempting here. Note we do not have a Flex console nor CLI implementation. Backend management is currently limited to the MongoDB shell :-)
